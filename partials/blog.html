		<p id="blogPageDescription">In June 2017, I embarked on a journey with Nashville Software School, beginning with the Web Development JumpStart class.  This was a 3-week, intensive introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then, on July 8, 2017, I began a year-long, part-time full stack web development bootcamp. Please feel free to read through my periodic blogs about my successes and my trials through this journey!</p>
