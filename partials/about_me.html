		<p class="pageInfo">When I am not educating others or learning new things myself, I have many interests that keep me busy. I enjoy curling up with a novel - mystery/supsense is my favorite genre. You might also find me in front of a sewing and/or embroidery machine. I love taking blocks of fabric and making them into a quilt, blanket, a pair of pants, or many other items. During the summer months, you are likely to find me in a pool, walking my dog, or (my favorite) on the beach in Florida.</p>
