    <p>As a current elementary educator, I believe in being a life-long learner. I earned a B.S. in Education from the University of TN at Martin, and an M.A. in Teaching from Trevecca Nazarene University. During my time as an educator, I have developed a love of using technology in the classroom to enhance students' education. In doing so, I found a desire to learn not only how to utilize technology to teach, but also how to use it to create new things. As I was talking with a friend about this, I was introduced to Nashville Software School. I began my journey with NSS in June 2017. I am currently attending a part-time, evening class to become a Full Stack Developer. The core languages we are learning are HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. We will also learn C# and .NET. I am excited to see where this journey leads me in the future! </p>
